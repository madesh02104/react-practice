This project was done to get used to react routers and it was code along with reference from traversey media's react crash course.

What have i learned in this project : 
    -How to create different pages in react using routes.
    -How to render components based on url
    -dynamic segments, mocking db using json-server package,loaders in react.

To see the live page : 

Since i have mocked the json file (jobs.json) as a backend database using the json-server package, creating a live demo for this requires a server to run the db. Since backend is beyond my scope of learning, i couldn't do that.So, if you want you can clone the repo to your local machine and run "npm install"(make sure you have the node environment setup) in the project folder. Then you can build it using "npm run build" to view the live site :).
